  🚧 EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION OF LINUX 🚧
</h3>

---
#### 📢 ABOUT:
**Find out about the evolution of the Linux operating system by exploring its version control system.**

---
#### ⚠️ PROJECT:
*Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) ) there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that you'll encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the development activities over the last 13 years.*

*For this Project, you need to be familiar with Pandas DataFrames, especially the read_csv and groupby functions, as well as working with time series data.*
